# Halfadder
A half adder is a digital circuit that adds two single-bit binary numbers and produces a sum bit (s) and a carry bit (c) as output.
It is the simplest type of adder circuit and is used in combinational logic design and arithmetic logic units (ALUs) in microprocessors.
A half adder can be implemented using various logic gates, including:
One EX-OR gate for the sum output (s)
One AND gate for the carry output  (c)
Alternatively, a half adder can be constructed using NAND gates or NOR gates.
Half adder adds two single-bit binary numbers
Produces a sum bit (s) and a carry bit  (c) as output
No forwarding of carry addition; the carry output is immediate
